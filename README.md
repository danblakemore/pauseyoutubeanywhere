pauseyoutubeanywhere
====================

Play/pause youtube and/or pandora from anywhere using a script and chrome-cli

Once you have this script, you can, for example, create an Automator service which runs the script when a keyboard shortcut is pressed (on Mac OS X).


Thanks to [@cobbal][1] for invaluable help developing this during work hours.
